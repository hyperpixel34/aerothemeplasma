## Prerequisites <a name="preq"></a>

Before installing AeroThemePlasma, it's important to know which display server you're running on (Wayland or X11). This can be checked using Plasma's Info Center page in the settings. It's recommended to run AeroThemePlasma on X11 for now, as it's generally the more stable and feature rich experience (certain restrictions on the Wayland session make some effects and features impossible to achieve, this should hopefully be addressed in the future).

### Arch Linux

Required packages:

```bash
pacman -S git cmake extra-cmake-modules ninja curl unzip qt6-virtualkeyboard qt6-multimedia qt6-5compat plasma-wayland-protocols plasma5support kvantum base-devel
```

Since Plasma 6.4, the X11 session has been separated from the main codebase. On Arch Linux, additional dependencies for X11 include:

- `kwin-x11`
- `plasma-x11-session`

KSysGuard has been officially deprecated by KDE, however an unofficial [port](https://github.com/zvova7890/ksysguard6) exists for Qt6, which can be installed using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ksysguard6-git) package on Arch-based distros.

### Note: Dependencies for other distros besides Arch Linux have been provided by contributors and aren't updated frequently, which may result in incorrect or missing dependencies.

### Fedora KDE

Required Packages:

```bash
dnf install plasma-workspace-devel unzip kvantum qt6-qtmultimedia-devel qt6-qt5compat-devel libplasma-devel qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtwayland-devel plasma-activities-devel kf6-kpackage-devel kf6-kglobalaccel-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel wayland-devel plasma-wayland-protocols kf6-ksvg-devel kf6-kcrash-devel kf6-kguiaddons-devel kf6-kcmutils-devel kf6-kio-devel kdecoration-devel kf6-ki18n-devel kf6-knotifications-devel kf6-kirigami-devel kf6-kiconthemes-devel cmake gmp-ecm-devel kf5-plasma-devel libepoxy-devel kwin-devel kf6-karchive kf6-karchive-devel plasma-wayland-protocols-devel qt6-qtbase-private-devel qt6-qtbase-devel kf6-knewstuff-devel kf6-knotifyconfig-devel kf6-attica-devel kf6-krunner-devel kf6-kdbusaddons-devel kf6-sonnet-devel plasma5support-devel plasma-activities-stats-devel polkit-qt6-1-devel qt-devel libdrm-devel
```

On Fedora, additional dependencies for X11 include:

- `kwin-x11`
- `kwin-x11-devel`

## Getting started <a name="started"></a>

To download this repository, clone it with `git`: 

```bash
$ git clone https://gitgud.io/wackyideas/aerothemeplasma.git aerothemeplasma 
$ cd aerothemeplasma
```

It's highly recommended to use git for downloading AeroThemePlasma as updating becomes much easier.

There are two ways to install AeroThemePlasma: Using the provided install scripts, and manual installation. In both cases, further configuration is required by the user.

## Using install scripts <a name="scripts"></a>

This is the recommended way of installing ATP. The install scripts compile and deploy the components required for ATP to work. Run the install scripts in the terminal:

```sh
$ sh compile.sh --ninja
$ sh install_plasmoids.sh --ninja
$ sh install_kwin_components.sh
$ sh install_plasma_components.sh
$ sh install_misc_components.sh
```

During execution, some scripts may require admin privileges or other prompts from the user. Do **NOT** run any of the provided install scripts with sudo or as root.

Wayland users need to additionally pass `--wayland` to `compile.sh`.

### Install script details

You can also run the install scripts like this:

```bash
$ chmod +x compile.sh && ./compile.sh
```

You can additionally pass `--ninja` to any of the following scripts in order to build using Ninja instead of GNU Make, which is recommended to reduce build times:

- `compile.sh`
- `install_plasmoids.sh`
- Any individual `install.sh` script

### Note for Wayland users

The compile script must be run while passing the `--wayland` argument for KWin effects:

```bash
$ sh compile.sh --wayland --ninja
```

If compiling individual KWin effects by running their respective `install.sh` scripts, you can also pass the `--wayland` argument there:

```bash
$ sh install.sh --wayland --ninja
```

### Updating AeroThemePlasma

Update the downloaded repository by pulling the new changes:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/aerothemeplasma
$ git pull
```

and re-run the install scripts:

```sh
$ sh compile.sh
$ sh install_plasmoids.sh
$ sh install_plasmoids.sh --no-compile # If there's no need to recompile the C++ parts of the plasmoids, you can pass this argument to speed things up
$ sh install_kwin_components.sh
$ sh install_plasma_components.sh
$ sh install_misc_components.sh # Usually not required to run again
```

Typically it's enough to run the first four scripts after ATP has been updated. It's highly recommended to check for new commits and read the extended descriptions in order to see what has actually changed and what's required when updating. 

When doing a full system upgrade, KWin effects and `libplasma` modifications tend to stop working. Running `compile.sh` after a full system upgrade is required for them to work again (assuming no breaking upstream changes).

## Manual installation <a name="manual"></a>

If installing ATP manually, the only script that should be run is the compile script as described previously. 

After that, follow these steps:

### Plasma components

1. Move the folders `desktoptheme`, `look-and-feel`, `plasmoids`, `layout-templates`, `shells` into `~/.local/share/plasma`. If the folder doesn't exist, create it. These folders contain the following:

   - Plasma Style
   - Global Theme (more accurately, just the lock screen)
   - Plasmoids
   - Plasma shell
   - Preset panel layout that can be applied from Edit mode
   
### Note for SevenTasks:

SevenTasks relies on modifications found in `misc/libplasma` in order to work properly. Make sure that they're compiled and installed correctly before enabling SevenTasks.

2. Compile all the C++ components found in the `plasmoids/src` directory like this for each source directory:

```bash
$ sh install.sh --ninja
```

3. Move `sddm/sddm-theme-mod` to `/usr/share/sddm/themes`. Optionally, to enable the Vista start screen, set `enableStartup=true` in `theme.conf.user`
4. Move `sddm/entries/aerothemeplasma.desktop` to `/usr/share/wayland-sessions`, and `sddm/entries/aerothemeplasmax11.desktop` to `/usr/share/xsessions`. This will install the SDDM entries required for ATP.
5. Import and apply the color scheme through System Settings.

### KWin components

1. Move the `smod` folder to `~/.local/share`, and/or `/usr/share/` for a system-wide installation. This will install the resources required by many other components.
2. Move `effects`, `tabbox`, `outline`, `scripts` to `~/.local/share/kwin`.
3. Run the following inside `~/.local/share/`:

```bash
$ ln -s kwin kwin-x11
$ ln -s kwin kwin-wayland
```

### Miscellaneous components

1. Move the `Kvantum` folder (the one inside the `kvantum` folder) to `~/.config`, then in Kvantum Manager select the theme.
2. Unpack the sound archive and move the folders to `~/.local/share/sounds`, then select the sound theme in System Settings.
3. Unpack the icon archive and move the folder to `~/.local/share/icons`, then select the icon theme in System Settings.
4. Unpack the cursor archive and move the folder to `/usr/share/icons`, then follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj7co2R7RKw) guide to install the cursor theme.
5. Move the files located in `mimetype` into `~/.local/share/mime/packages` and then run `update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime` to fix DLLs and EXE files sharing the same icons.
6. Segoe UI, Segoe UI Bold, Segoe UI Semibold and Segoe UI Italic are required for this theme and they should be installed as system-wide fonts.

If SDDM fails to pick up on the cursor theme, go to System Settings -> Startup and Shutdown -> Login Screen (SDDM), and click on Apply Plasma Settings to enforce your current cursor theme, and other relevant settings. Do this _after_ installing everything else. If even that fails, change the default cursor theme in `/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme` to say `aero-drop`.

### Font configuration

To enable full font hinting just for Segoe UI, move the `fontconfig` folder to `~/.config`. This will enable full font hinting for Segoe UI while keeping slight font hinting for other fonts. Additionally, append `QML_DISABLE_DISTANCEFIELD=1` into `/etc/environment` in order for this to be properly applied. _While full font hinting makes the font rendering look sharper and somewhat closer to Windows 7's ClearType, on Linux this option causes noticeably faulty kerning. This has been a [prominent](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/11765) [issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/656) [for](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/463) [several](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/404) [years](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/2394) [now](https://www.phoronix.com/news/HarfBuzz-Hinting-Woe) and while the situation has improved from being unreadable to just being ugly, a complete solution for this doesn't seem to be coming anytime soon._

### Custom branding

To install custom branding for the Info Center, move `kcm-about-distrorc` from the `branding` folder to `~/.config/kdedefaults/`, then edit the file's `LogoPath` entry to point to the absolute path of `kcminfo.png`.


### Plymouth theme

Optionally, install [PlymouthVista](https://github.com/furkrn/PlymouthVista) which supports Windows 7 boot animations, and features a more detailed setup guide.

### Polkit User Account Control modification

### WARNING:

### Installing random modifications to programs that deal with privilege escalation (giving sudo or root access to users) from unknown or untrustworthy sources is reckless and a giant security risk. Even though this modification to KDE's polkit authentication UI is purely cosmetic, it's generally not recommended to modify sensitive applications such as this. If you don't know what you're doing, or do not trust the modified source code, do not install this particular component of AeroThemePlasma.

1. Navigate to the `uac-polkitagent` folder, and run `install.sh`:

```bash
$ chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --ninja
```

2. To remove the minimize and maximize buttons from the window, run `add_rule.sh` which will generate the appropriate KWin rule:

```bash
$ chmod +x add_rule.sh && ./add_rule.sh
```

## Configuring AeroThemePlasma <a name="conf"></a>

1. After installing everything, restart the computer. In SDDM, make sure to select the appropriate session (AeroThemePlasma (X11) or AeroThemePlasma (Wayland)).
2. Apply the Global Theme after logging into the ATP session. 
3. Right click on the desktop and open "Desktop and Wallpaper", and select "Desktop (Win7)" under Layout, and apply the changes.
4. In System Settings, apply the following settings:

- In Window Behavior -> Titlebar Actions:
  - Mouse wheel: Do nothing
- In Window Behavior -> Window Actions: (For Wayland users only)
  - Inactive Inner Window Actions, Left click: Activate, raise and pass click
- In Window Behavior -> Task Switcher:
  - Main: Thumbnail Seven, Include "Show Desktop" entry
  - Alternative: Flip 3D, Forward shortcut: Meta+Tab
- In Window Behavior -> KWin Scripts:
  - Enable Minimize All, SMOD Peek (**Wayland users should keep SMOD Peek disabled as it doesn't work and can cause freezing**)
- In Window Behavior -> Desktop Effects, enable **all** effects in the AeroThemePlasma category. Additionally enable the "Desaturate Unresponsive Applications" effect.
- In Window Behavior -> Desktop Effects, **disable** the following:
  - Background Contrast
  - Blur
  - Dialog Parent
  - Dim Inactive
  - Dim Screen for Administrator Mode (From Focus category)
  
5. Configure KWin animations to the following:

![animations](screenshots/animations.png)

6. In System Settings -> Colors & Themes -> Colors, set "Accent color from color scheme"
7. In System Settings -> Session -> Desktop Session, uncheck the "Ask for confirmation" option.
8. In System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, under KWin, disable the "Peek at Desktop" shortcut, and remap the "MinimizeAll" to Meta+D
9. In System Settings -> Colors & Themes -> Cursors -> Configure Launch Feedback, set Cursor feedback to "None"
10. In System Settings -> Fonts, configure the fonts as shown here:

![fonts](screenshots/fontconfig.png)

The following steps are optional:

11. For Wine users it's recommended to install the [VistaVG Ultimate](https://www.deviantart.com/vishal-gupta/art/VistaVG-Ultimate-57715902) msstyles theme.
13. Add the following to `~/.bashrc` to get bash to look more like the command prompt on Windows:

```bash
PS1='C:${PWD//\//\\\\}> '

echo -e "Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\n"
```

14. In the terminal emulator of your choice (e.g Konsole), set the font to [TerminalVector](https://www.yohng.com/software/terminalvector.html), size 9pt. Disable smooth font rendering and bold text, reduce the line spacing and margins to 0px, set the cursor shape to underline, and enable cursor blinking.
